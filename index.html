							<p>Alzheimer's disease is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder. 
								Familial forms of Alzheimer's disease associated with the accumulation of a 
								toxic form of amyloid-β peptides are linked to mitochondrial impairment. 
								<br />
								<br />
								My research focuses on potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease 
								using cell and fly models in combination with human genetic, biochemical, 
								behavioural and brain imaging data. I recently used experimental results in 
								flies to human medical records and showed that increasing the bioavailability 
								of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to promote mitochondrial 
								health could reduce pathologies related Alzheimer's disease 
								<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-021-03926-y">(published in Cell Death & Disease, Yu et al., 2021)</a>
								. 
								
								I am now pursuing further research on the toxic effect of amyloid-β and how to reduce its toxicity.
								
								<br />
								I am also involved in a few collaborative works. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
								I completed research projects on how air pollution and neurodegenerative diseases 
								could affect COVID-19 infection and death. 
								
								I am also involved in a project on using machine learning to investigate 
								the off-target effect of drugs on mitochondria.

											<h4>Parp mutations protect from mitochondrial toxicity in Alzheimer's disease</h4>
										</header>
										<p> <small> We analysed the metabolomic changes in flies overexpressing Aβ and 
											showed a decrease of metabolites associated with nicotinate and 
											nicotinamide metabolism, which is critical for mitochondrial function in neurons. 
											We used combined results in flies and in humans to show that increasing the bioavailability of NAD+ protects against Aβ toxicity.

											<h4>Links between air pollution and COVID-19 in England</h4>

										<p> <small> We explored potential links between 								fuel-related air pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 mortality in England. 
											Using regional-level data, we found positive relationships between  nitrogen oxides and COVID-19 mortality and 
											 infectivity. Using the UK Biobank data, we further showed that PM2.5 was 
											 a major contributor to COVID-19 cases in England: an increase of 1 m3 in

										<p> <small> We show that a pre-existing diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease predicts the highest risk of COVID-19 and mortality among elderly individuals. In contrast, Parkinson’s disease patients were found to have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection but not mortality from COVID-19.</small> </p>
