								<h2>Research</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
								My PhD work combined multiomic methods, with animal models and cultured cells to identify therapeutic targets for Alzheimer’s disease. 
								I showed a protective function of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-021-03926-y">Yu et al., 2021</a>),
								one carbon metabolism (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-024-07179-3">Yu et al., 2024</a>), and nucleotide metabolism (under review) in delaying Alzheimer's diease pathology.
								When speaking to patients, I learned that sleep disruption can preceed disease diagnosis and that poor sleep quality is a major issue for patients. By combining metabolomics, proteomics, single-cell genomics and epidemiological analysis, 
								I found a novel connection betweeen sleep-related genes and AD (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.26.640405v1.abstract">Yu et al., 2025</a>). 
								Insights from my PhD research and beyond led us to found <a href="https://www.healthspanbiotics.com/">Healthspan Biotics</a>, which aims at improving neuronal health using a safe, 
								effective and affordable probiotic supplement. 
								<br>
								 Since 2023, I joined Prof Sarah Teichmann’s group at the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute and 
								 Wellcome Sanger Institute as a Senior Computational Biologist. There, I have been applying Human Cell Atlas technologies to study inflammatory neuropathy.

											<h2>Approach </h2>
										</header>
			
										<p><strong>What</strong>
											<br />
											My goal is to unravel diseases by integrating insights from the genomic, epigenomic, transcriptional, proteomic, metabolomic, inter-organ and behavioural levels.
											By leveraging technological advances in both laboratory techniques and AI, we are able to collect and analyse exponentially more data at higher resolution. 
											By getting a better understanding of human biology during disease, we will be able to pinpoint mechanistic biomarkers and therapeutic targets that can be translated into personalized interventions.
										</p>

										<p><strong> How </strong>
											<br />
											To achieve this, I have been using cellular models, animal models (mainly fruit flies), patient samples and epidemiological-scale data. This integrative approach can overcome limitations in these individual methods.

											<h4>Parp mutations protect from mitochondrial toxicity in Alzheimer's disease</h4>
										</header>
										<p> <small> We analysed the metabolomic changes in flies overexpressing Aβ and 
											showed a decrease of metabolites associated with nicotinate and 
											nicotinamide metabolism, which is critical for mitochondrial function in neurons. 
											We used combined results in flies and in humans to show that increasing the bioavailability of NAD+ protects against Aβ toxicity.

											<h4>Links between air pollution and COVID-19 in England</h4>
										</header>
										<p> <small> We explored potential links between 
											fuel-related air pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 mortality in England. 
											Using regional-level data, we found positive relationships between 
											nitrogen oxides and COVID-19 mortality and 
											 infectivity. Using the UK Biobank data, we further showed that PM2.5 was 
											 a major contributor to COVID-19 cases in England: an increase of 1 m<sup>3</sup> in 
											 PM2.5 level was associated with a 12% increase in COVID-19 
											 cases. </small> </p>

											<h3>Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases Predict Different COVID-19 Outcomes

										</header>
										<p> <small> We show that a pre-existing diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease predicts the highest risk of COVID-19 and mortality among elderly individuals. In contrast, Parkinson’s disease patients were found to have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection but not mortality from COVID-19.</small> </p>

											<h3>Paracetamol is associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 infection and

							<p> I am currently a PhD student in Dr L. Miguel Martins' research group. 
								I previously graduated from Imperial College London in 2019 with a BSc 
								in Biological Sciences (first-class honours). During my first degree, 
								I completed internships with Dr Giorgio Gilestro to investigate sleep 
								in flies as well as with Prof Masud Husain and Dr Michele Veldsman to 
								investigate associations between poor sleep and neuroimaging markers.

								<br />

								In my spare time, I like to row and participate in hackathons.
